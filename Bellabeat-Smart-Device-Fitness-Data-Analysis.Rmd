### Business task:
 Analyze non Bellabeat smart device usage data to identify trends. Then, using this information, make high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

### Data Source:
 FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. The Data contains 18 files which are written in long format.

### Data Limitations:
Bellabeats products are for women and the Fitbit data doesn't specify gender, there is no demographic information and the data is limited (30 users only) therefor there could be a sampling bias.



### Setting up the environment
setting up my R environment by loading the following packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(gridExtra)
```

### Importing the data
after inspecting the data in excel it appears that the `dailyCalories_merged.csv`, `dailyIntensities_merged.csv`, `dailySteps_merged.csv` have been merged into `dailyActivity_merged.csv`. So, I will only use the following:
```{r}
daily_activity <- read.csv("/Users/Abeer/Desktop/Google Data Analytics/Bellabeat-Smart-Device-Fitness-Data-Analysis/Bellabeat-case-study/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read.csv("/Users/Abeer/Desktop/Google Data Analytics/Bellabeat-Smart-Device-Fitness-Data-Analysis/Bellabeat-case-study/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight <- read.csv("/Users/Abeer/Desktop/Google Data Analytics/Bellabeat-Smart-Device-Fitness-Data-Analysis/Bellabeat-case-study/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
hourly_steps <- read.csv("/Users/Abeer/Desktop/Google Data Analytics/Bellabeat-Smart-Device-Fitness-Data-Analysis/Bellabeat-case-study/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlySteps_merged.csv")
hourly_intensities <- read.csv("/Users/Abeer/Desktop/Google Data Analytics/Bellabeat-Smart-Device-Fitness-Data-Analysis/Bellabeat-case-study/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")
```

### Data cleaning
Take a look at the data & clean the columns names
```{r}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% clean_names()
daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>% clean_names()
weight <- weight %>% clean_names()
hourly_steps <- hourly_steps %>% clean_names()
hourly_intensities <- hourly_intensities %>% clean_names()
head(daily_activity)
head(daily_sleep)
head(weight)
head(hourly_steps)
head(hourly_intensities)
```

how many users in each dataset? 
```{r}
n_distinct(daily_activity$id)
n_distinct(daily_sleep$id)
n_distinct(weight$id) # only 8 users therefore i will not use it 
n_distinct(hourly_steps$id)

```


check for missing and duplicate observations
```{r}
sum(is.na(daily_activity))
sum(is.na(daily_sleep))
sum(is.na(hourly_steps))
sum(is.na(hourly_intensities))
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(daily_activity))
sum(duplicated(daily_sleep))
sum(duplicated(hourly_steps))
sum(duplicated(hourly_intensities))
```


remove duplicates from `daily_sleep`
```{r}
daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>% distinct()
sum(duplicated(daily_sleep))
```


we can see that the data type for date columns is char
```{r}
str(daily_activity)
str(daily_sleep)
str(hourly_steps)
str(hourly_intensities)
```


fix the date columns format (i will ignore the time in sleep_day since all observations are 12:00:00)
```{r}
daily_activity$activity_date <- as.Date(daily_activity$activity_date, "%m/%d/%y")

daily_sleep$sleep_day <- as.Date(daily_sleep$sleep_day, "%m/%d/%y")

hourly_steps$activity_hour <- strptime(hourly_steps$activity_hour, "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")
hourly_steps$hour <- strftime(hourly_steps$activity_hour, "%H:%M")

hourly_intensities$activity_hour <- strptime(hourly_intensities$activity_hour, "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")
hourly_intensities$hour <- strftime(hourly_steps$activity_hour, "%H:%M")

```

To identify outliers i will create a boxplot then i will use the IQR method to remove outliers, since the dataset is small and I’m not sure it’s representative of the population of interest i decided to be more conservative and remove only extreme outliers
```{r}

boxplot(daily_activity$total_steps, outcol="red")


```
IQR method
```{r}
#daily activity total steps
summary(daily_activity$total_steps)

IQR(daily_activity$total_steps)

Tmin = 3790 - (3 * 6937.25)
Tmax = 10727 + (3 * 6937.25)

#outliers
daily_activity$total_steps[which(daily_activity$total_steps < Tmin | daily_activity$total_steps > Tmax)]

#remove outliers
daily_activity <- daily_activity[(daily_activity$total_steps > Tmin & daily_activity$total_steps < Tmax),]
```



### Analysis


```{r}
#minutes asleep vs steps

#first i will use rowSums function to sum across rows and create total_intensities_distance column  
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% mutate(total_intensities_distance = rowSums(across(c(light_active_distance, moderately_active_distance, very_active_distance))))
#now i will inner_join daily_sleep and daily_activity to create the plot 
daily_sleep <- inner_join(daily_sleep, daily_activity[ , c("id", "activity_date", "total_steps", "sedentary_minutes", "total_intensities_distance")], by = c("id" = "id", "sleep_day" = "activity_date"))

g1 <- ggplot(data = daily_sleep, mapping = aes(x = total_minutes_asleep, y = total_steps)) + geom_point()  + geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#fe8f77") + theme_linedraw() +labs(title = " Steps vs Minutes asleep", 
         x = "minutes asleep", y = "number of steps") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) 
  
#steps vs time in bed
g2 <- ggplot(data = daily_sleep,mapping = aes(x= total_time_in_bed, y = total_steps)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#fe8f77") + theme_linedraw() + labs(title = "Steps vs Time in bed", x = "minutes in bed", y = "number of steps") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) 




g1grob <- ggplotGrob(g1)
g2grob <- ggplotGrob(g2)

grid.arrange(g1grob, g2grob, nrow = 1)
```

Here i wanted to see if there is a correlation between number of steps with minutes asleep and minutes in bed, we can see that the data points follow no direction. This means there is no correlation.



```{r}
#Steps vs time of the day
steps_time_trends <- hourly_steps %>% group_by(hour) %>% 
  summarise(avg_steps_per_hour = mean(step_total)) %>% 
  arrange(hour)
 
g3 <- ggplot(data = steps_time_trends, mapping = aes(x= hour, y = avg_steps_per_hour, group = 1 )) + geom_line(color = "#fe8f77") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + labs(x = "Hour of the day", y = "average number of steps") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) 

#intensities vs time of the day
intensity_time_trends <- hourly_intensities %>% group_by(hour) %>% 
  summarise(avg_intensity_per_hour = mean(total_intensity)) %>% 
  arrange(hour)

g4 <- ggplot(data = intensity_time_trends, mapping = aes(x= hour, y= avg_intensity_per_hour, group = 1)) + geom_line(color = "#fe8f77") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + labs(x = "Hour of the day", y = "average intensity") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) 

g3grob <- ggplotGrob(g3)
g4grob <- ggplotGrob(g4)

grid.arrange(g3grob, g4grob, nrow = 1)

```

we can see that users are the most active from 8 AM to 7 PM especially around break time for most 9-5 jobs.  



```{r}

#intensities vs calories
g5 <- ggplot(data = daily_activity, mapping = aes(x = total_intensities_distance, y = calories)) + geom_point() +geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#fe8f77") + theme_linedraw() + labs(title = "Daily Calories vs Intensities", x= "intensity", y = "calories") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) 


#daily steps vs calories
g6 <- ggplot(data = daily_activity, mapping = aes(x = total_steps, y = calories)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#fe8f77") + theme_linedraw() +labs(title = "Daily Calories vs Steps", 
         x = "number of Steps", y = "calories") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) 
g5grob <- ggplotGrob(g5)
g6grob <- ggplotGrob(g6)

grid.arrange(g5grob, g6grob, nrow = 1)

```

As the intensity and number of steps increase, the calories burned also increases therefore there is a positive correlation.


```{r}
# minutes asleep vs sedentary
g7 <- ggplot(data = daily_sleep, mapping = aes(x = sedentary_minutes, y = total_minutes_asleep)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#fe8f77") + theme_linedraw() + labs(title = "Minutes asleep vs Sedentary", x = "sedentary minutes", y = "minutes asleep")

#intensities vs sleep

g8 <- ggplot(data = daily_sleep, mapping = aes(x = total_intensities_distance, y = total_minutes_asleep)) + geom_point() +geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#fe8f77") + theme_linedraw() + labs(title = "Minutes asleep vs Intensities", x= "intensity", y = "minutes asleep") 

g7grob <- ggplotGrob(g7)
g8grob <- ggplotGrob(g8)


grid.arrange(g7grob, g8grob, nrow = 1)

```

we can see that there is a moderate negative correlation between minutes asleep and sedentary, meanwhile there is no correlation between minutes asleep and intensity.
